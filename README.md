# Project Title

Ad Optimisation with AI

## Summary

In ad optimisation there are few basic elements which you need to check and decide your optimisation. Like Publishers, Creatives, Daily, AdExchange vs impressions, clicks and CTR.


## Background

There are few problems which will be solved through this project. 
* problem 1
  In a ad campaign there are hundreds and thousand of publishers, checking it manually and individually is a very time-consuming task
* problem 2
  After downloading all reports, taking decisions based on cross reports can be complex at times, and sometimes it can lead to major mistakes


## How is it used?

After generating or downloading reports in .XLSX or .CSV format these reports will be given as data input and it should respond with recommendations which requires urgent attention, or we should stop or invest more.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
