# Project Title

Ad Optimisation with AI

## Summary

In ad optimisation there are few basic elements which you need to check and decide your optimisation. Like Publishers, Creatives, Daily, AdExchange vs impressions, clicks and CTR.


## Background

There are few problems which will be solved through this project. 
* problem 1
  In a ad campaign there are hundreds and thousand of publishers, checking it manually and individually is a very time-consuming task
* problem 2
  After downloading all reports, taking decisions based on cross reports can be complex at times, and sometimes it can lead to major mistakes


## How is it used?

After generating or downloading reports in .XLSX or .CSV format these reports will be given as data input and it should respond with recommendations which publishers and creative size should be blacklisted or we should invest more based on the performance that requires urgent attention, or we should stop or invest more.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

This is how you create code examples:

## Challenges

It will not take decisions of it's own. Also can't solve manual instruction or briefs given by advertisers specifically for a campaign. For example, if the advertiser wants to show majority ads at BBC.com, even if the campaign performs below the benchmark still the adops needs to continue serving ads at bbc.com. So this will not work or solve the problem

## What next?

With more cross-report analysis and recommendation, we can get more optimisation capabilites to perform better and decision making faster. Now the power of digital ad is to show ads at the right time at the right place. This report can help us to take one step ahead towards being at the right time to the consumer.
